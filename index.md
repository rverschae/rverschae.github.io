# About

I am an associate professor at the Institute of Engineering Sciences, Universidad de O'Higgins, Chile. Before that (2015-2018), I was an assistant professor at the Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan.

My research interests include computer and robot vision, machine learning, and intelligent and robot systems with various applications (energy, agriculture, etc.).
  
I received a Doctoral degree in Electrical Engineering (Universidad de Chile, 2010), a M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics (Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS) de Cachan, France, 2006), an Electrical Engineering degree (Universidad de Chile, 2003), and a Bachelor in Computer Engineering degree (Universidad de Chile, 2002).   

From 2020 to 2023, I was director of the Institute of Engineering Sciences, Universidad de O'Higgins, Chile. I have been a Postdoctoral Researcher (principal researcher of the FONDECYT Grant N. 3120218) at the [Advanced Mining Technology Center (AMTC)](http://www.amtc.cl), Universidad de Chile, (2011-2013), a visiting foreign researcher (7 months, BecasChile Grant) at the [Kyushu Institute of Technology](http://www.kyutech.ac.jp/), Fukuoka, Japan (2011), a research fellow at the Network Design Research Center,  at the [Kyushu Institute of Technology](http://www.kyutech.ac.jp/), Japan (2009-2010), an associated researcher at the [Fraunhofer IPK-Institute](http://www.ipk.fraunhofer.de/en/homepage/), Berlin, Germany (2004-2005), and a research collaborator of the [Center for Web Research](http://www.cwr.cl/) at Universidad de Chile (2004). 

I have participated in international projects and developed algorithms for large-scale industrial systems, and at age 46 (2024), I am an active researcher with over 60 publications in international conferences and journals.
