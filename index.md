# About

Since April 2015 I am a program-specific assistant professor at the Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, where I am working on distributed coordinated energy management of prosumer communities, and multi-camera underwater 3d fish tracking ([at the Matsuyama Lab](http://vision.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/)), among other topics. 
  
I received a Doctoral degree in Electrical Engineering (Universidad de Chile, 2010), a M.Sc. in Applied Mathemathics (Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS) de Cachan, France, 2006), an Electrical Engineering degree (Universidad de Chile, 2003), and a Bachelor in Computer Engineering degree (Universidad de Chile, 2002).   

I have been a Postdoctoral Researcher (principal researcher of the FONDECYT Grant N. 3120218) at the [Advanced Mining Technology Center (AMTC)](http://www.amtc.cl), Universidad de Chile, (2011-2013), a visiting foreign researcher (7 months, Becaschile Grant) at the [Kyushu Institute of Technology](http://www.kyutech.ac.jp/), Fukuoka, Japan (2011), a research fellow at the Network Design Research Center,  at the [Kyushu Institute of Technology](http://www.kyutech.ac.jp/), Japan (2009-2010), an associated researcher at the [Fraunhofer IPK-Institute](http://www.ipk.fraunhofer.de/en/homepage/), Berlin, Germany (2004-2005), and a research collaborator of the [Center for Web Research](http://www.cwr.cl/) at Universidad de Chile (2004). 

I have participated in international projects, developed algorithms for large scale industrial systems, and at age 38 (2016), I am an active researcher with over 55 [publications](pub) in international conferences and journals. 

My current [research](research) interests include: 
----
+ Distributed, autonomous, robotic and multi-agent systems
+ Coordinated energy management
+ Computer and robot vision, machine learning, pattern recognition
+ Object detection and recognition; scene understanding.
