# About

Since March 2018 I am an assistant professor (tenure track) at the Institute of Engineering Sciences, Universidad de O'Higgins, Chile, and before that (2015-2018) I was a assistant professor at the Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University. Japan. 

My research interest include computer and robot vision, machine learning, and intelligent and robot systems with various applications (energy, agriculture, etc.).
  
I received a Doctoral degree in Electrical Engineering (Universidad de Chile, 2010), a M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics (Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS) de Cachan, France, 2006), an Electrical Engineering degree (Universidad de Chile, 2003), and a Bachelor in Computer Engineering degree (Universidad de Chile, 2002).   

I have been a Postdoctoral Researcher (principal researcher of the FONDECYT Grant N. 3120218) at the [Advanced Mining Technology Center (AMTC)](http://www.amtc.cl), Universidad de Chile, (2011-2013), a visiting foreign researcher (7 months, BecasChile Grant) at the [Kyushu Institute of Technology](http://www.kyutech.ac.jp/), Fukuoka, Japan (2011), a research fellow at the Network Design Research Center,  at the [Kyushu Institute of Technology](http://www.kyutech.ac.jp/), Japan (2009-2010), an associated researcher at the [Fraunhofer IPK-Institute](http://www.ipk.fraunhofer.de/en/homepage/), Berlin, Germany (2004-2005), and a research collaborator of the [Center for Web Research](http://www.cwr.cl/) at Universidad de Chile (2004). 

I have participated in international projects, developed algorithms for large scale industrial systems, and at age 40 (2019), I am an active researcher with over 55 publications in international conferences and journals. 

My current research interests include: 
----
+ Distributed, autonomous, robotic and multi-agent systems
+ Coordinated energy management
+ Computer and robot vision, machine learning, pattern recognition
+ Object detection and recognition; scene understanding.
